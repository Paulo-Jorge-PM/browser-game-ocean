I want to create a browser game, like the ones from the past (OGame, Travian, Tribal Wars, Fallen London, etc.). I want it to be a light web browser game, like in the past, like Ogam style, but with better animations, UI and more interactive. The tech stack should be JS based for frontend, and Python based for the backend.

The game is about a dystopian future, where nuclear war and climatic change destroyed all main cities, increased temperature, and made the oceans rise all over the world. Our game happens in the ocean, we are trying to rebuild civilisation itself. We start with a special base ship, that  will allow us to build and expand to under the water, building a city under the ocean, made of underwater bases. The game is grid based, where the player builds vertically from the top of the ocean to the bottom of the ocean. The player can select a grid cell, and select which under ater base to build next, he can only build by connecting to already existing bases. The base type choice is critical for the strategy of the game: we can build residential bases, various food gathering bases, mining bases, resources extraction bases, oxygen and clean water extraction bases (for more population), telecommunications bases (to later open up communication between different players cities), war bases (to build war machines to attack other cities or protection), etc. We want to build a grid based browser game, similar to the classic RTS games and games like Caesar 3 and Pharaoh or Dwarf Fortress, were we see the little humans working underwater to keep the city alive (animated little figures), and we manage the city building path and strategy by choosing bases, constructions, tech threes, resources management, and warfare etc. The game UI should have the grid map above, with the resources numbers at the top like an hover top bar, and a bottom bigger panel where players see contextual options when they select a cell or a base, and by default it shows generic choices to open new window panels for like tech trees, communications, automation, etc. I want to add a feeling like Metal Gear Solid, in which the story progression is via agents communications, in which AI starts inter comm communication with the player via voice an text like in MGS, with scripted communications and choices, which tell a story and make the game progress. The game is a massive multiplayer game, in which players share a server, and each city can interact via a Global map exploration via special unit types. Players while exploring the deep ocean will also find artefacts from before the nuclear apocalipse war, with pieces of real world history and trivia and old monuments, that collection and exploration is also an important part of the game. Players will be able to communication via chat and voice, while they evolve the tech tree. They will be able to form world governments, make diplomacy and elect rooting world leaders, or wage war, forming clans and alliances. A ranking system will be very important for the success of the game, in which we will have a daily, a weekly, monthly and year ranking of the most succefull cities in various vectors. The game visual will be mostly 2D, modern, interactive with animations. The game world map will follow our real world map, players will be able to join real countries zones (for instance join Portugal ocean zone, France ocean zone, etc.), and the rankings will be by country zone. Also the servers will be divided based on real continents.
The tech stack should be a javascript based one for frontend and a python or Rust based one for backend. Please start by creating two folders: one for frontend, other for backend, to divide the code base, we'll need to develop both sides in this repo. Please start by making a plan, suggest best tech stacks for us to lock in (focus on the tech stacks for best results with you, and for best results in real world), then create a Claude.md file with this context I am giving you and the plan to achieve it and tech stack we choose.
